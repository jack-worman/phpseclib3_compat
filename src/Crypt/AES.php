<?php

/**
 * Pure-PHP implementation of AES.
 *
 * Uses mcrypt, if available/possible, and an internal implementation, otherwise.
 *
 * NOTE: Since AES.php is (for compatibility and phpseclib-historical reasons) virtually
 * just a wrapper to Rijndael.php you may consider using Rijndael.php instead of
 * to save one include_once().
 *
 * If {@link self::setKeyLength() setKeyLength()} isn't called, it'll be calculated from
 * {@link self::setKey() setKey()}.  ie. if the key is 128-bits, the key length will be 128-bits.  If it's 136-bits
 * it'll be null-padded to 192-bits and 192 bits will be the key length until {@link self::setKey() setKey()}
 * is called, again, at which point, it'll be recalculated.
 *
 * Since \phpseclib3\Crypt\AES extends \phpseclib3\Crypt\Rijndael, some functions are available to be called that, in the context of AES, don't
 * make a whole lot of sense.  {@link self::setBlockLength() setBlockLength()}, for instance.  Calling that function,
 * however possible, won't do anything (AES has a fixed block length whereas Rijndael has a variable one).
 *
 * Here's a short example of how to use this library:
 * <code>
 * <?php
 *    include 'vendor/autoload.php';
 *
 *    $aes = new \phpseclib3\Crypt\AES('ctr');
 *
 *    $aes->setKey('abcdefghijklmnop');
 *
 *    $size = 10 * 1024;
 *    $plaintext = '';
 *    for ($i = 0; $i < $size; $i++) {
 *        $plaintext.= 'a';
 *    }
 *
 *    echo $aes->decrypt($aes->encrypt($plaintext));
 * ?>
 * </code>
